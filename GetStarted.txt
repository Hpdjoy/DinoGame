Instructions to Recreate DinoGame

Materials Needed:

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
Breadboard and jumper wires
16x2 LCD display
I2C Module for 16x2 (1602) Character LCD
Push buttons (for controls)


Step-by-Step Guide:

Setup Arduino Environment:
Install the Arduino IDE from the official website and set it up for your operating system.
Ensure your Arduino board is connected and recognized by the IDE.

Connect Components:
Wire the 16x2 LCD display to the Arduino following its datasheet or pinout guide.
Connect push buttons to the Arduino for controls (e.g., one for jumping).

Upload Libraries:
Install any necessary libraries for the LCD display and button inputs in the Arduino IDE. Examples include LiquidCrystal library for the LCD and Button library for handling button inputs.
Write and Upload Code:

Write the Arduino sketch (code) for DinoGame. This involves:
Initializing the LCD display and setting up button inputs.
Implementing game mechanics such as dinosaur movement (jumping and ducking), obstacle generation (cacti and dino), collision detection, and score tracking.
Adding game loops for gameplay continuity.

Test and Debug:
Upload the code to your Arduino board.
Test the game to ensure all components are functioning correctly.
Debug any issues with gameplay mechanics or component interactions.
Customize and Expand:

Customize the game by tweaking gameplay parameters (e.g., speed, obstacle frequency).


Invited feedback, suggestions, and contributions to improve and evolve DinoGame.

Conclusion:
Recreating DinoGame involves setting up Arduino components, coding game mechanics, testing functionality, and sharing my creation with others. Enjoy the process of building and customizing your own Arduino-powered retro gaming experience!
