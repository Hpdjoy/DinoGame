need help!
no Problem I am here!

In the cicuit diagram the display shown contains only 4 pin which is I2C display.

some lcd Displays may not directly contain 4 pins instead it contains 16 pins on it.
for that we need an I2C module (I2C Module for 16x2 (1602) Character LCD). Directly solder it on display or better use a breadboard.
